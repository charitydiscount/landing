# Charity Discount Landing Page

Landing page showcasing the main features of CharityDiscount.

## Usage

- `gulp` or `gulp build` builds the page(s) (minify, inline, translate)
- `gulp watch` for local development (serves the ro-RO version, can be changed in _gulpfile.js_)

## Features

- As fast as it gets - **all** the css is purged, minified and inlined directly in the html file. (custom js is also minified/inlined - not purged because it doesn't block the rendering)
- Translation - support for multiple languages (resulting in different html files for each individual language)
- SCSS/SASS support

### Thanks

This project is based on [Start Bootstrap's New Age Landing Page](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/new-age/). Check it out.
